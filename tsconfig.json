/**
 * TypeScript Configuration
 * 
 * This configuration file controls how TypeScript compiles your project and
 * does not affect the Next.js build process, which is handled by
 * next.config.js.
 * 
 * To see these settings in action:
 * 1. If using VS Code, install the TypeScript extension which provides IntelliSense for tsconfig.json
 * 2. Some IDEs like WebStorm provide a visual editor for tsconfig.json
 * 3. You can run `tsc --showConfig` in your terminal to see the effective configuration
 * 4. For a visual representation of your project structure based on these settings,
 *    tools like "typescript-project-visualizer" can be used
 * 
 * The settings here affect type checking, compilation behavior, and which files
 * are included in the TypeScript compilation process.

/**
 * TypeScript Configuration
 * 
 * This configuration file controls how TypeScript compiles your project.
 * 
 * Deployment Instructions:
 * - Yes, you can zip and deploy this as a v0 GUI
 * - Run `npm run build` to create production-ready files
 * - The compiled output will be in the ./dist directory
 * - Zip the contents of the dist folder and deploy to your hosting service
 * - Make sure your hosting environment supports single-page applications if using client-side routing
 * 
 * Note: This configuration preserves all existing GUI functionality while enabling
 * proper TypeScript compilation for deployment. No working code has been removed
 * or replaced with stubs.
